Minute Minis were designed to help students learn the abstract concept of time using concrete representations of fractions. Specifically, they wanted to help children in second grade use what they already know about telling time (to the nearest half hour) to learn to tell time more precisely (in increments of 5 and 15 minutes) while also learning the part-whole meaning of fractions.
